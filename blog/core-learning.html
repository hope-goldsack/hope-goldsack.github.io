    <h1>Core Learning</h1> 
    <h1>"What surprised me the most about learning core is..."</h1>
    <p>---------------------------------</p>
    <p>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
    </p>
    <p>Three new things! Wow, this has had me thinking for a while. Mostly, at the beginning I struggled to ask for help. I thought this showed that I wasn’t good enough and I compared myself to others thinking if they got it surely I will! BUT sometimes this wasn’t the case, I have learned to reach out for help from others to problem solve better rather than running around in circles in my brain.
    </p>
    <p>Self-awareness, I have learned to be more aware of how I am as a person generally. I learned my ego stopped me from doing proper planning for how things will actually fit with my life, instead I overwhelmed myself. Now I know to plan for what I CAN do and not to beat myself up if things change, or I don’t have time. Also to allow more time for myself versus rushing.</p>
    <p>Growth, I have learned I still have the capacity to learn and develop myself, both emotionally and intellectually. By embracing change, challenging limiting beliefs, and expanding my comfort zone, I was able to evolve into a more resilient, compassionate, and self-aware person.
    </p>
    <p>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
    <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness are important in learning and programming. Values guide our decisions and behaviour, and empathy helps understand users and collaborate effectively. Self-awareness helps identify strengths, weaknesses, and learning needs. Together, they promote teamwork and personal growth in programming.
    </p>
      <p>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</p>
      <p>I was really surprised by how much more I learned about myself, unlocking perspectives I had never considered. I was able to use what I have learned through core not only during this journey of becoming a ‘coder’, but it has also benefited me in my everyday mahi and life. I’m really surprised that it has in a way impacted the way I think in a long term way.</p>
  <p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
  <p>Reflecting on my strengths was hard some weeks, like this week, I have been absolutely overwhelmed and stressed with everyday life. I just couldn’t bring myself to come and sit down to consider my ‘feelings’, this has probably been the hardest part about core. It's very personal and reflective which can be a challenge some days.</p>
  <p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
  <p>It helps improve skills like communication and problem-solving, enhances professional growth, prepares students for client interactions, promotes well-being and resilience, and assists in building a professional image. This holistic approach recognizes that web developers need more than just technical skills to succeed in their careers.</p>
  <p>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
  <p>No it doesn't feel like a waste of time. I have found core learning really valuable, it helps me to understand things that challenge me and how they relate to my personality and weaknesses. As well it has shown me how I can use my strengths to better attack problems with my code. Overall I have really enjoyed the experience and it has taught me amazing things that I can carry with me into any situation.</p>
