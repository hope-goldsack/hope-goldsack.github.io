    <p>This blog takes you through my journey to becoming a full stack developer.</p>
    <p>Here are a few fun facts about me, so you can know me a little better before jumping into my blog!</p>

    <ul>
  <li>I have 2 beautiful tamƒÅhine, Esther who is 6 & Bella who is 4.</li>
  <li>I am a big homebody, I love to be nice and cosy in my own safe space.</li>
  <li>I love to listen to crime podcasts to relax, weird right!?!</li>
  <li>I am a Taurus, I'm sure that will already tell you enough right!</li>
    </ul>
<p>I don't really like to talk too much about myself to be honest, 
  so this blog is a great chance for me to reflect on myself and open up a little more.
I hope you enjoy reading my blog and following me on this wild ride.</p>
