          <li class="it-text">
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </li> 
          <p>This is going to be a bit personal, or maybe strange. But my 'ethical' decisions would mostly revolve around my whanau or friends.
            For example if I know something that may affect a person in a certain way I try to decide the best way to tell them, if I should tell them,
            why, and who the information is from. For me I prefer honesty, and trust - in this case I let them know whatever it may be as it is their decision what they should do or feel about it.
            I am happy and feel content, I do not like a stiff or anxious room, or space, this helps me to maintain this space. Always honesty and kindness.
</p>          
            <li class="it-text">
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
          </li>
          <p>
            I like to think I have an interesting life which has been shaped by both my whanau and what I have been exposed to. Growing up in a firmly christian household I learned about equality, kindness, honesty, putting others first and sharing love wherever possible (there are so many other amazing values I learned here but too much to list!). These values have shaped who I am, the way I treat people, and the way I approach everyday tasks. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I was lucky to grow up with connections to an iwi through my tīpuna, this has had an instrumental role in making up my identity. I live my life by very strong tikanga and I teach my children the same, the tikanga closest to me are aroha - giving with no expectation of returned love, loving and giving unconditionally. Whakawhanaungatanga - building and establishing strong relationships with those who enter into my life. Kotahitanga - unity and togetherness, regardless of who you are or where you are from. Manaakitanga -  the values of hospitality, kindness, generosity and respect, extending aroha to others. 
          </p>
          <p>
            And finally one tikanga that is very important to me and my whanau at home is kaitiakitanga. Kaitiakitanga understands that whenua is a taonga and we as people are guardians over it, protecting it, living mindfully, respectfully and more sustainably.
Generally, my upbringing and culture has shaped my values. I am caring, kind, thoughtful, inclusive, loving and selfless both towards other people and the whenua the earth we live on.

            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
          </li>
          <p>
            I think everyone has a reasonable idea of what their strengths are, these tests and quizzes definitely confirmed them for me and showed me a couple of other strengths which is quite cool to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOPE defined my Peacock personality as, “they love talking, being the centre of attention, have passion, enthusiasm, and are happily optimistic.” The last 3 values particularly stood out to me as essential for my learning journey, they work well together too. My passion, enthusiasm and optimism will definitely benefit me, as I am able to learn from my mistakes or problem-solve without putting myself down and regardless of how I feel in a moment I still retain the passion to push through. I always think of the best possible outcome rather than the worst, it definitely gives me determination as I believe I CAN do it even if there is some resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Big 5 had my favourite explanation of my strengths, “You have a genuine love of ideas, and value originality, creativity, and imagination. It is important to you to have consistent opportunities to learn new things and improve your mind. You value intellectual challenge, depth of thought, and insight. Because of your interest in enlightenment and novel ideas, you place great value on artistic and cultural endeavours. You believe that the improvement of the mind is an important and worthy goal.” Interestingly this relates to the topic of growth mindset, knowing you can achieve your goal and positively looking toward the future. Understanding that my learning isn't stagnant and it can continue to flourish and grow is something I have always believed in. We never stop learning and growing which is an amazing part of being human, we don’t have to stand still, we can control how we move through life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding this course, these values are integral especially considering the problem solving element. If I can approach problems with a I can solve this attitude rather than this is too hard lots of things change, I can push that little bit further to achieve the desired outcome. Also my interest in growing intellectually to learn, my interest in improving my mind and my general love of problem solving will be a huge asset to my learning journey. Problem solving is definitely important as a developer, having this as a strength of mine and actually having the confidence to move forward. I think I will really enjoy my devacademy journey and embrace every sprint with a positive openness to learn.

          <li class="it-text">
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          </li>
          <p>
            Interestingly without taking these tests I was already quite aware of what my limitations are. The Big 5 gave me a lower score of 42% for conscientiousness which they define as “a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked”. This is very true, from school all the way to adulthood I have been told (and my parents were told too, eeeek lol) the ‘she could have so much potential but she is too easily distracted’ line from my teachers. There are many possibilities that could arise from this limitation, it could mean I don’t manage my workload well so I would freak out and rush at the last minute. The thing with rushing is that knowledge isn’t usually retained, I need to be more organised with my time management as well as learning to turn down plans for the sake of my learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOPE personality test defined me as the Peacock who is the Excitement Seeker. While it has many positive traits, it showed me a really similar outcome to the other test. DOPE says Peacocks can “be accused of talking too much and aren't good with detail or time-management”. Here it is again, the recurring theme, I need to spend more time organising my life so I can set myself up for success. If I don’t focus or balance my time there is a high probability things may start to unravel in my development in this course.

          <li class="it-text">
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </li>
          <p>
            I am the founder of a charity called Community Koha, it is an app which links communities together through koha. We have a team of 7 people who work for us, with this big team there has definitely been its highs and lows. An example of experiencing resistance or tension would be when we lost a couple of key players within our development team, this created some tensions within the team. We had to reassess the entire project, we all felt daunted by this. It changed our timelines, responsibilities and so much more. We had to sit down and reassess as a team what our new future would look like so we came together to do just that. Honesty and transparency is such an important strategy to maintain team morale, everyone voiced their concerns and intentions for the future too so we had a firm understanding of the best way forward. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am quite happy with the outcome and problems we solved by being open and honest. We created a working agreement in which everyone could add their values and what they expected from the team moving forward so we wouldn’t be blindsided by changes in the future. The best way forward was to become one organism where everyone was just as valuable as each other, rather than lots of different bits that might fit. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a project manager for our project I have gained a lot of experience in resolving issues. This is reflected in my strengths, the big 5 test stated my openness is at 96% “Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences.” I think this is why I am able to take negative situations and think of what we could do to move forward, often I do take a different or abstract approach compared to other people.
