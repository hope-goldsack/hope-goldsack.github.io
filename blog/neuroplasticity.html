    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1> 
    <p>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visualising and imagining the practice has added value alongside physical practice to the connection pathways and strengthens them to keep strong pathways.</li>
      <li>Intelligence is relative, it can change if your mind realises its ability of growth rather than stagnation.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The learning journey journal is a fantastic way to start, this will help me to visualise and imagine the work I have done so it is added value alongside my physical practice.</li>
      <li>Reflecting will not only reinforce my learning but it will also help me realise my capability to improve my intelligence, become more confident and positive about my abilities so I can learn to believe I have the capacity to grow intelligence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Commit to engaging in the exercise as frequently as you can both in imagining and physical practice.</li>
      <li>Have good control over my timetable as well as my rest time, use it well to increase my ability to focus.</li>  
      <li>Make errors, test myself, find solutions, become frustrated and come back to try again. While also considering my challenges and thinking about these practices and how they can be navigated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> ------------------ </p>
     <h1>Growth Mindset</h1> 
    <p>What is Growth Mindset and why it is relevant?    </p>
    <p>Development and growth is important to the course, it isn’t just about getting everything right it is about the challenges that come with it, and the help/advice you receive. Growth mindset is changing the way you train your brain to think, rather than using a typical fixed mindset. The Harvard Business Review defines it as “people who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset.
      It is relevant here as there will be challenges, with a positive growth mindset a better belief in your ability will enhance learning.    </p>
<p>Were there any suprises or changes during this exploration?</p>
    <p>I have been studying for a long time & I tend to challenge myself with new challenges within my life very often. I have a strong belief that when using a positive attitude that I can learn and have the capability to develop further to increase my overall intelligence and learning journeys. </p>
    <p>Intergrating a Growth Mindset into my learning journey</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To embrace challenges as positive learning experiences to learn and develop a better understanding of the problems.</li>
      <li>As quoted before, hard work will improve confidence, as well as increasing a positive mindset.</li>  
      <li>Good strategies, such as effective time management.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>A lot of this blog was written when these concepts were first introduced at the start of the course. As the course has gone on I have found myself
    adapting my learning style. Knowing these concepts I have had so much more confidence in so many areas, especially trusting my gut, believing I have the capacity and intelligence to
    solve big issues myself - which has actually enabled me to be a better coder. I have tried to explain my learning to others, and spent more time mentally practicing
    the topics we have been introduced to which really has had a huge impact on my learning. I will continue to reflect on these concepts and utilise them as much as I can throughout this course and into the future.
    You really never stop learning!
