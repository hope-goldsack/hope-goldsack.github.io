    <h1>Git Commands - 'reset'</h1> 
    <p>reset: This command is used to reset the current branch to a specific commit or state. 
      It can be used to unstage changes or move the branch pointer to a different commit.
    </p>
    <p>The "reset" command in Git is like an old school VCR, rewinding a movie takes you to a specific scene & 
      fast-forwarding to a different one, you can choose to either record over the movie, or 'modify' along the way. 
      It helps manage the branch's state and commit history effectively.</p>
      <p>Here's an example of what I encountered today:</p>
      <p>I got swept up into my server-side-rendering exercise, and rushed myself, and so I made a lot of silly mistakes.
        I freaked out because I didn't know where I made the issue (that will teach me for not doing my commits more often)!
        Anyway, I decided this was the perfect opportunity to use one of the 'new' git commands.
      </p>        
      <p>-------------</p>
      <p>These are the steps I took to perform the ```git reset```</p>

    <p>1. This was the code I needed to reset, I went down a slippery slope, I know, I know haha.</p>
    <img class="center" src="../images/git2.png" alt="Loop example"> 
      <p>2. This is where ```git reset``` really starts to shine, start by using the command in you terminal.</p>

      <p>Hover over the word 'reset' in the command line & click. It will drop down these three reset options.</p>
      <p>
        <li>```reset``` - without an option moves the branch pointer to a specific commit</li>
        <li>```soft reset``` - moves the branch pointer while keeping changes staged</li>
        <li>```hard reset``` - moves the branch pointer and discards all changes, both staged and unstaged</li>
      </p>
    <img class="center" src="../images/git4.png" alt="Loop example">       
    <p>I choose to do a ```hard reset``` as I knew I wasn't happy with my coding session at all, it was all over the place 
      so starting fresh from my original commit was definitely my best option.
    </p>
<p> ------- </p>
<p>Moral of my story here, sometimes it is too late to be up coding hahha.</p>
<p>NgƒÅ Mihi koutou!</p>
