    <h1>All things Javascript, Html & CSS</h1> 
    <p>So you want to learn more about Javascript, HTML & CSS but it is too daunting, 
      and where do you even start. Last week I was you, 
      timid but excited to learn more about this golden trio - 
      holy trinity - the three musketeers; lol I should stop there, 
      actually one more the three blind mice, I’m done I promise.
    </p>
    <p>Picture going to eat a meal at a Michelin starred restaurant, 
      there are so many elements that go into the final creation of 
      the dish. To create a beautiful, tasty and provocative meal 
      you need to get a few things right first: </p>
      <p>The ingredients - I like to think of these as the HTML - 
        the foundation of the meal, the ingredients shape the meal 
        from start to finish and they dictate what will make the meal 
        complete. In developer words, HTML acts as the foundation, 
        providing the structure and content of your web page. 
        It defines the basic layout, text, images, and other 
        essential elements.</p>
      <p>Then consider the overarching concept of the meal, 
        will there be smoke - what kind of elements will make the meal 
        more interactive and captivating, maybe a surprise inside a 
        chocolate, or a flavour you weren’t looking for - this is the 
        Javascript - it makes things responsive and animated. 
        JavaScript allows you to automate tasks, create dynamic 
        functionality, and interact with your visitors - 
        it brings life to your web page, enabling you to build 
        interactive forms, validate user input and so so much more.</p>
      <p>And finally the design and plating aka the CSS - this is what 
        you see first when your meal arrives, you look at its colours 
        and the presentation. Again, in developer words CSS is 
        responsible for the aesthetics and visual appeal of your web 
        page. It determines the colours, fonts, positioning, and 
        overall styling drawing you into the page. </p>
      <p>All of these elements, you know - the holy trinity - come together to make one responsive and cohesive website or app, or whatever you would like to develop. </p>
        <p>-------------</p>
  <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>  
      <p>Control flow refers to the order in which instructions are 
        executed in a program. It determines the path your code 
        takes based on conditions and loops. To explain control 
        flow, let's use the example of a skincare regime.</p>
      <p>This is going to sound strange, I’m sure - 
        but consider skincare. There are steps that must be taken 
        to ensure the best results in the long term. You can’t use 
        serums and toners prior to cleansing and moisturising - 
        ok really bare with me haha. Essentially, there is a set of 
        instructions to follow, in skincare this is, cleanser, toner,
         serums, moisturiser, eye cream, and then sunscreen - 
         man how hard is it to keep acne away! Where I am getting at 
         is each step is executed sequentially, one after the other, 
         until the face is primed and ready for the next step, most 
         likely make-up. This sequential execution represents the 
         control flow in programming.
      </p>
      <p>Now, loops. Loops allow us to repeat a set of instructions
         multiple times. To better understand loops, let's imagine
          you're organising a children's party and need to send out
           invites.</p>
      <p>Rather than sending invitations across town, via text or on 
        facebook, some in person - you get it, confusing and time 
        consuming. Instead you can save yourself time, chaos and 
        probably a little money and invite everyone via a facebook 
        event the information is the same and it is repeated to 
        everyone who is invited - one easy to track place without 
        all of the text RSVPS or lost invitations. This repetition 
        of adding friends to the invitation list represents a loop, 
        you can use a loop to simplify the process. Loops help to 
        repeat instructions clearly multiple times if needed.</p>
        <p> Below is an example of a loop:</p>
    <img class="center" src="../images/Screenshot 2023-06-02 125209.png" alt="Loop example">
      <p>Confusing without context, right? Here's what the loop is doing for us.</p>

<h1>The DOM</h1>
<p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like model, allowing you to interact with and manipulate the elements within a web page.</p>
<p>Consider the DOM as a map or blueprint of your page. Each element, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and buttons, is represented as a node in the DOM tree. You can navigate this tree, access individual nodes, modify their content, attributes, or styles, and even add or remove elements dynamically.</p> 
<p>Look at the following example, you can see a button labelled "Fill Order." </p>  
<img class="center" src="../images/Screenshot 2023-06-02 122416.png" alt="Button">
<p>JavaScript helps you to access this button element in the DOM and add an event listener to detect when it's clicked. When the button is clicked, you could then modify the text of a paragraph element or perform any desired action.</p>

<h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
<p>Arrays and objects are special ways to store and organize information. Let's say you are at school, and you need to do your algebra but you need to find the book but this is easy because it always sits in the same position in your bag, so you can locate it easily without having to search endlessly. That's how arrays work!</p>
<p>Arrays are like your notebooks with sections for each topic. Each section holds different bits of information. Someone else should be able to find exactly what you need and where it is due to this organisation. Arrays are helpful when you want to store and find things quickly.</p>
<p>Objects are like having a pantry. Each item has its own individual tags and packaging, and you can find it by its name. For example, if you want to find your flour, you open the pantry and find the container named, you guessed it, flour! Objects are great when you want to store and find things using names instead of numbers.</p>
<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Functions are like spells that help you do amazing magical things in JavaScript. Imagine you are Harry Potter and you have a special wand that can do different spells. Each spell has a special name and instructions to perform it. That's just like a function, if you get the spell wrong everything around it could fall apart!</p>
<p>When you want to do a spell, you say its name and follow the instructions. Functions in JavaScript are like these spells you can use over and over again, depending on the situation of course!! Just like spells help the wizards win their battles, functions make coding easier because you can reuse your spells anytime you need them.</p>
<p>Functions are like having a bag full of magic spells that can make your code do amazing things. They help you create games, solve puzzles, and bring your ideas to life!</p>
<p> ------- </p>
<p>JavaScript is an exciting, daunting and satisfying adventure where you get to build amazing things. You use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fun and interactive experience. With control flow, loops, the DOM, arrays, objects, and functions, you can make incredible things happen with just a few lines of code. Dive in and give it a go!!</p>
