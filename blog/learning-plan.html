                      </li> 
            <p>
Currently I am the founder of an app which is in development. My team and I have a future planned with lots of new projects and exciting things along the way!
My goal is to be a full stack developer which will enable me to work along side my team. We aim to work on new innovtive, sustainable, big dream apps that can hopefully change the world.

            <li class="bold-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning            </li>
            <p>
              My strengths:
            </p>
          <p>
            I am determined - while doing my bachelors degree I fell pregnant TWICE and had babies at home for 6 years. This didn't hold me back. I was determined to finish, and I bloody passed with honors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a dreamer - I love to dream big, no idea is ever a bad idea. There are no, no's only maybe is my motto. Give anything a go, you never know where it will take you. Life is meant to be lived, chase those dreams, believe in yourself.          
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a fast learner - this is pretty self explanatory. There's a few reasons for this, but mostly it is time related, you know kids and life it is sometimes hard to find a few minutes. But in that few minutes I am able to retain a lot. I have trained my brain to be effective doing my bachelors degree while having 2 babies helped with this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am positive - this is similar to the other strengths coming up. I always see the good side of the coin, never the bad. I like to have a positive outlook on everything I do, if there is a challenge it may seem hard but I am always positive while I work my way through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate - I put my heart and wairua into everything I do in my life. Nothing is half-hearted, there is always a purpose for everything I do and I will chase that purpose until it's finished!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am enthusiastic - this explains itself, I am a bouncy ball of energy, fun, and ready for anything. You name it, I'm there ready to go!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a team player - this allows me to work harmoniously with my peers, in my mahi, and in everyday life. I am everyone's biggest advocate, everyone should have the opportunity and support to succeed and reach their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am open to suggestions, concerns, and even criticism - this allows me to think outside of my own box, and expand my understanding or processes. As well as in life, I am always growing, changing, and learning. There's nothing wrong with being 'wrong', it's about how you move forward from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love a challenge - the feeling when you overcome a hoop in life, or mahi, it's so satisfying and rewarding at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My weaknesses:
          </p>
          <p>
            Difficulty asking for help - I like to follow things through on my own, maybe to prove something to myself? I definitely need to work on this as there is nothing wrong in asking. My silly old pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can be a little disorganised - in this sense it comes down to my time management with all of my life things. I have a lot of different things going on, kids, mahi, more mahi, managing a business, the list goes on and on, and on. You get it. This is a big area I need to work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I lack patience - when I do something I like to do it quickly, and all at once. This means I am more susceptible to mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I lack an attention span - this ties in with patience, I have a very limited attention span. This means I can only do short blocks of work, rather than hours and hours. Mind you with developing I have noticed I get into a groove and 3 hours have passed. So who knows?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ask my husband I'm sure he could expand a lot on this list haha. So don't ask him lol!
