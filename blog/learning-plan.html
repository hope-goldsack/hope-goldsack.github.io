              What is your long term goal or career pathway?  
                      </li> 
            <p>
Currently I am the founder of an app which is in development. My team and I have a future planned with lots of new projects and exciting things along the way!
My goal is to be a full stack developer which will enable me to work along side my team. We aim to work on new innovtive, sustainable, big dream apps that can hopefully change the world.

            <li class="bold-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning            </li>
            <p class="it-text">
              My strengths:
            </p>
          <p>
            I am determined - while doing my bachelors degree I fell pregnant TWICE and had babies at home for 6 years. This didn't hold me back. I was determined to finish, and I bloody passed with honors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a dreamer - I love to dream big, no idea is ever a bad idea. There are no, no's only maybe is my motto. Give anything a go, you never know where it will take you. Life is meant to be lived, chase those dreams, believe in yourself.          
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a fast learner - this is pretty self explanatory. There's a few reasons for this, but mostly it is time related, you know kids and life it is sometimes hard to find a few minutes. But in that few minutes I am able to retain a lot. I have trained my brain to be effective doing my bachelors degree while having 2 babies helped with this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am positive - this is similar to the other strengths coming up. I always see the good side of the coin, never the bad. I like to have a positive outlook on everything I do, if there is a challenge it may seem hard but I am always positive while I work my way through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate - I put my heart and wairua into everything I do in my life. Nothing is half-hearted, there is always a purpose for everything I do and I will chase that purpose until it's finished!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am enthusiastic - this explains itself, I am a bouncy ball of energy, fun, and ready for anything. You name it, I'm there ready to go!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a team player - this allows me to work harmoniously with my peers, in my mahi, and in everyday life. I am everyone's biggest advocate, everyone should have the opportunity and support to succeed and reach their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am open to suggestions, concerns, and even criticism - this allows me to think outside of my own box, and expand my understanding or processes. As well as in life, I am always growing, changing, and learning. There's nothing wrong with being 'wrong', it's about how you move forward from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love a challenge - the feeling when you overcome a hoop in life, or mahi, it's so satisfying and rewarding at the same time.
          </p>
          <p class="it-text">
            My weaknesses:
          </p>
          <p>
            Difficulty asking for help - I like to follow things through on my own, maybe to prove something to myself? I definitely need to work on this as there is nothing wrong in asking. My silly old pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can be a little disorganised - in this sense it comes down to my time management with all of my life things. I have a lot of different things going on, kids, mahi, more mahi, managing a business, the list goes on and on, and on. You get it. This is a big area I need to work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I lack patience - when I do something I like to do it quickly, and all at once. This means I am more susceptible to mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I lack an attention span - this ties in with patience, I have a very limited attention span. This means I can only do short blocks of work, rather than hours and hours. Mind you with developing I have noticed I get into a groove and 3 hours have passed. So who knows?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ask my husband I'm sure he could expand a lot on this list haha. So don't ask him lol!
          </p>
            <li class="bold-text">
What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?            </li>
            <p>   
              I am going to be honest, over the years I have gained a lot of skills and street smart working many environments.
              Being a mother you learn to deal with so much and it really makes you evaluate yourself and work on yourself.
              As well, I have been incredibly sick and experienced a lot of different things in life which have made me very self aware and resilient.
              Having a big family always adds to your human skills, especially when you're the middle child and so default mediator.
              I think creating a plan and sticking to it. Learning how to practice more and do the bare minimum less. 
              Learning more about the growth mindset and how I can really incorporate this into my life will be interesting and a challenge sometimes I am sure.
           </p>

            <li class="bold-text">
A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:            </li>
            <p>
I will manage my workload by setting timeblocks during my week which I need to stick to in order to stay ontop of the course load, be productive and avoid frustration.
I will work in an inclusive manner with my peers, and anyone else in the network.
I will be sure to talk to facilitators about my concerns, or frustrations to find better solutions if my workload is too heavy.
I will also reassess my workload and time to create a new plan that will work better for me.
            </p>

            <li class="bold-text">
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way            </li>
            <p>
My commitment here is I will perform the steps & tasks from the 'asking for help' section of the handbook. 
            </p>
<li>Problem solving - reviewing my code</li>
<li>Breaking down the problem into smaller pieces</li>
<li>Searching the 'tech-help-forum' for possible solutions</li>
<li>Asking for help via the appropriate discord forum, "tech-help-forum", "core-questions", my "homegroup", or my facilitators</li>
<p>When requesting help I will ensure I take the appropriate steps to paint a clear picture of my problem, this will enable those who can help to understand my issue better.
  I will ask for help, rather than spending hours and hours frustrated and stressed over it.
</p>
            <li class="bold-text">
              A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </li> 
              <p>
I'm not sure what I expect here. I think something that will be very important to me is open and honest communication, as well as some understanding of my life situation - aka things unfortunately pop up,
like sick kids or whanau issues. I highly doubt these will arise, but they could. I think knowing that I can approach my facilitators and they will give me an honest, but compassionate response.
               </p>

            <li class="bold-text">
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.            
            </li>
  <p class="it-text">My tamariki:</p>
  <li>School pick ups & drop offs:</li>
  <p>Drop offs are - 8.00am - 9.00am</p>
  <p>Drop offs are - 2.30am - 3.30pm</p>
  <li class="it-text">Miscellaneous:</li>
  <p>After school activities & whanau time are - 2.30pm - 7.00pm</p>
  <p>Afternoons on the weekends, however this is variable and I will be able to do more mahi if needed as my husband will be home.</p>

  <p class="it-text">My mahi:</p>
  <li>Weekly tasks that do not change:</li>
  <p>Kapahaka teaching - Mondays 9.00am - 1.00pm</p>
  <p>CoKoha mahi & hui - Tuesdays & Thursdays - 10.30am - 1.00pm</p>
<p>Outside of these tasks nothing is concrete and time is very flexible - I may have casual meetings pop up over the week but I can choose the schedule for these. I prefer to work on dev mahi between 10am & 2pm and late at night, 7pm and onwards.</p>
