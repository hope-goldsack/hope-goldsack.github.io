    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1> 
    <p>We have all heard of IQ at some point in our lives, whether you
      heard it in a situation like me - eg. the constant battle within my household
      of 5 children we all wanted to be the best. We were in our teens but boy did
      we want the best IQ. It was amazing to be able to challenge myself
      even though it may have been in vein.
    <p>At this stage I had NEVER heard of EQ, so until now this concept or understanding never
      crossed my mind - howeve the concept of street smart always was in the forefront.
      Unlike my sister who is an honors student who always prided herself on her high IQ,
      again a highly competitive family lol - she never had that 'street smart' 
      the ability to think with her emotions rather than her intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>Of course I am going to talk myself up her - why not (just don't tell my sister)!
      I have what I believe to be a very high EQ, which to me also means 'street smart'.
      I am able to camellion myself into so many situations, make people feel important,
      and be active and confident when necessary. As well as this, I have a high IQ too which I feel so blessed to have.
      ANYWAY, I digress.
    </p>
    <h1>So what is the difference between IQ & EQ....</h1>
      IQ stands for Intelligence quotient. It measures cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
      memory, and analytical thinking. These measures indicate success for a person, both in academic and intellectual pursuits.
      High IQ ca be an advantage in certain jobs that require learning complex concepts, especially in areas such as
      science, technology, and all of those other hard things haha. My sister did TWO degrees (way to rub it in) her first in Fine Arts,
      the second in Accounting, she is very strong academically.
    </p>
    <p>Some cons of IQ can mean people can possibly a limited scope, neglecting their emotional intelligence in faour of IQ.
      Cultural bias, IQ may favour things like certain cultural or socioeconomic groups over others. Static measurement, IQ is a stable measurement
      that doesn't account for development over time or adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>EQ stands for Emotional Quotient. It measures a person's ability to understand and manage emotions, both
      internally within yourself and outside of yourself with others. EQ leads to empathy, strong communication skills, and relationships.
      It is highly beneficial when it comes to leadership positions and working within teams, these people are able to
      inspire and motivate people, mediate where needed, and building whakawhanaungatanga within their team.
      These people are also able to easily adapt, resilient in the sight of challenges, and recovery from possible setbacks.
      They are able to manage and recognise their emotions, allowing them to be equipt to navigate negative challenges both personally and professionally.
    </p>
    <p>Like IQ, EQ can be subjective. EQ doesn't have a true standardization, aka, there is no true standard yet which makes it difficult to compare or evaluate.
      Due to this the assessments can be subjective and relies on a lot of self-reflection and reporting, different tools lead to various results.
    </p>
  <h1>Why is EQ important?</h1>  
      <p>EQ has many amazing benefits such as, creating strong relationships, the ability to work well within teams as well as being an effective leader.
        It assists with emotional regulation and resilience, when problems arise people with a high EQ are more equipt to change and flexibility. This rolls into problem-solving and making good decisions,
        people with EQ are able to combat issues and solve them in a understanding manner.
        They are highly accepting of growth and personal development too!
