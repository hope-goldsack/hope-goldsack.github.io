    <h1>Problem Solving Reflections</h1> 
    <p>Blocked on Simple Problems</p>
    <p>The biggest problem I experienced throughout this past week was with the 'Gradebook' topic in the Javascript Kata.</p>
    <p>I had issues with simple mistakes, such as not checking my code accurately so I didn't find spelling mistakes that were causing a lot of small errors here & there. </p>
    <p>To understand the issues I tried many problem-solving techniques, pseudocode, console.logging. I also used google & chatgpt to try to understand the questions better, I rewrote the code, had a break and came back to the code, jumped onto my notes to find more information & then finally ended up having to get some help from John, my tutor.</p>
    <p>Throughout the process I felt pretty annoyed as I thought I was getting the code right, but it was a larger gramatical issue in earlier code that was messing me up in various areas so my final function wasn't working.</p>
    <p>In this process I learned I need to spend more time reading over my code and proof-reading more vigilantly. This way I can recognise small spelling mistakes etc that will eventually catch me off guard and have a huge impact on my code.</p>
<p>Elegantly Solved Problem</p>
    <p>The problem I am most proud of from this sprint was the 'whereAreYou' test in builtin-methods.</p>
    <p>To solve this problem successfully on my own I used a couple of problem solving techniques, starting with Pseudocode is super helpful for me it helps me to properly organise my thoughts.</p>
    <p>I also tried a LOT of things, constantly testing through the process & reading error messages on the terminal. I did a little googling to help me with some of the trickier bits but I was able to successfully find my way there on my own. That is what made this problem feel elegant, it started complex but I figured it out! YAY!</p>
    <p>At the beginning I felt a bit daunted by the issue as I wasn't able to break it down or understand it well at the beginning, but it got better the more I problem-solved and started to understand with more resources the more confident and assured I began to feel. By the end I was absolutely stoked with the result!</p>
    <p>I learned through a LOT of re-reading the notes, googling words & definitions were super helpful. I also made a reference masterlist which has been amazing. I learned I have retained more than I thought I did.</p>
<p>Confidence in problem-solving techniques</p>    
<ul>
  <li>Pseudocode - I feel very confident about this. It helps me to think about all the options I could try & how to break it down into smaller bits, attacking them one at a time not just the problem as a whole.</li>
  <li>Trying something - I feel confident about trying and trying again for sure, this is the best way to come to solve a problem. If you're not trying things then you'll never get an answer.</li>
  <li>Rubber ducky method - I have kids and a husband, so sometimes I pretend they are the rubber ducky haha. It definitely helps to see a problem differently or sparks different ideas.</li>
  <li>Reading error messages - I wasn't too confident with this at the beginning, the terminal looks a bit hectic and scary sometimes. John helped me to gain more confidence & assisted me in what parts I should pay close attention to. After I tried a few times it became one of my favourite problem solvers!</li>
  <li>Console.logging - Medium confidence, I am still getting used to this but I know it is super helpful. I will have to start making it a regular practice.</li>
  <li>Googling - Love it! Super confident! I'm sure this is a big crowd pleaser. Obviously like almost everyone on the planet after using years of google it is like my bestie. We have a real good relationship and I love to use it for definitions & different perspectives.</li>
  <li>Asking your peers for help - The more I get to know my peers the more confident I feel in asking them for help. I also know everyone is suuuuper busy doing their sprints so I am a bit apprehensive to ask for help. Not one of my most confident areas.</li>
  <li>Asking coaches for help - I feel a bit deflated if I get to this point, I like to try my best to work it out on my own. But I am learning to spend less time stressing on my own & more time having some discussions with our coaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking for help!</p>
  <p>As I mentioned before with my biggest simple problem that kept me up at night ooops. I just feel sometimes like I am giving up if I need to talk to a coach, I know that isn't the case but it is just my bloody mind playing tricks on me.
    I am working on this, especially putting up my hand more when I am stuck rather than spending 3 or more hours stressing on my own. There is no real reason, I just think deep down I like to feel like I have everything under control (even in real life) so this is a good lesson for me.</p>
